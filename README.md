## Getting started

### Requirements
1. Node 20+

### Local development
1. Clone this repo to your computer.
1. In a terminal, run `npm install` this repo's folder.
1. Run `npm run dev` to start a local server. You may be asked to login to Cloudflare.
1. Browse to `http://localhost:8787/list` to ensure you see the expected buckets.

### Additional details

1. You can make your own buckets tied to your own Cloudflare account or you can request a `.dev.vars` file.
2. Cloudflare KV, which is used for org properties and session login info is locally stored when developing locally. You will need to make your own local KVs to test against.
